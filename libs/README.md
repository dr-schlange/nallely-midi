# External Device Development Libraries

This folder contains the various bindings to develop external devices with Nallely that will connect to the WebsocketBus in a Nallely session in various languages.

Please refer to the technology you want to use for your external device:

* `js/` — JavaScript/TypeScript (external neuron)
* `python/` — Python (external neuron + client to drive a session)
* `llms/` — LLM system prompt / reference document for AI-driven session control

To write a connector in a new language, see [PORTING.md](PORTING.md).
