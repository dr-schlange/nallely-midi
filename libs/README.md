# External Device Development Libraries

This folder contains the various bindings to develop external devices with Nallely that will connect to the WebsocketBus in a Nallely session in various languages.

Please refer to the technology you want to use for your external device:

* `js/` - JavaScript/TypeScript (external neuron)
* `python/` - Python (external neuron + client to drive a session)
* `llms/` - LLM system prompt / reference document for AI-driven session control
* `ruby/` - Ruby (external neuron + client to drive a session)
* `C/` - C (external neuron)
* `pharo` - Pharo (external neuron + client to drive a session). The connector for Pharo (modern Smalltalk dialect) is avaiable in an [other github repository](https://github.com/dr-schlange/nallely-pharo). It would have been possible to integrate the source code in this repository, but it would have been potentially painful to maintain later.


## Write a connector in a new language

To write a connector in a new language, see [PORTING.md](PORTING.md). This document have been generated by an LLM for LLMs, you can either follow it manually and write the connector for your language yourself, it's trivial, but if you prefer, you can feed this file and the [LLM skill file](./llms/nallely-llm-skill.md) to an LLM and ask for the connector in your language.
