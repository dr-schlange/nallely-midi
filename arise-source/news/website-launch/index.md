# Launching a website for Nallely

This post inaugurate the creation of a small dedicated website for Nallely and Trevor. It will be the landing page for Nallely, as well as the source of some tutorials, experiments report, thoughts, demos, everything that touches Nallely from one point or another.

This will let me the possibility to document also the architecture of the system as well as the evolutions I'm planning to integrate, well, everything related to Nallely before I forget.

I'll integrate soon a small newsletter link so you can subscribe and get notified when something important or interesting gets here with Nallely.

The website is built using [Arise](https://ari.se.net/) and amazing static website generator written in Bash. Give it a try, it's light, open-source, and generates pure HTML.
