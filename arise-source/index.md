# A Hackable System for MIDI Experimentations

Nallely - pronounced "Nayeli" - is an organic open-source Python platform for experimentation around the idea of advanced MIDI signal processing for MIDI meta-synth creation. Nallely let's you customize and create your own modular instrument/machine from MIDI devices and computers distributed on the same network. Nallely can be used for live coding, generative music, multimodal art, and is built for hackers and musicians.

| Control multiple MIDI devices |  Patch your devices

Think about Nallely as a small brain, where each device is kind of biological neuron that receives signals and emits signals. All those small neurons are independent and can connect to each other in various ways. By connecting neurons as you want, you might connect some which - in a normal running brain - would not usually communicate. Consequently, you can build your MIDI brain to work as a normal brain, or you can experiment and make it works as if you had a brain under psychedelics, i.e: mapped in an unusual way, producing unexpected, but always amazing results.

Inspired by the Systems as Living Things philosophy and Smalltalk, Nallely tries to be as dynamic as possible, i.e: you can create your own meta-synth, build your custom MIDI brain while it runs, and from any computer/phone (touch friendly) from the network. Nallely - developed in Python - exposes an extensible core and an easy to use Python API so you can create your own neurons without efforts, and have them integrated directly in the system in a seemless way.


| Manage your patchs as a versioned memory | Tailor your neurons

Nallely is shipped with pre-existing neurons which are:

* abstraction of the physical world and can create sound using MIDI devices (the voice for your brain);
* signal computational neurons coded to filter, transform, split, generate signals;
* network buses where distributed remote neurons coded in any technology can register and emit or receive signals;
* meta-neurons which can control, create, modify other neurons.

Currently, Nallely embeds few remote neurons coded in Javascript introducing 3D visuals (mental imageries for your brain) which can be controlled by signals received from your MIDI brain, as well as a webcam-aware neuron to emit signals to your small MIDI brain (the eyes for your brain).
