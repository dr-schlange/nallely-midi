# AI Generated Virtual Devices

This folder contains virtual devices that are 100% generated using AI with very simple prompt (e.g: "Generate a 8 step sequencer virtual device") without any further information to measure and see if the internal API for virtual devices is powerful and simple enough.

Here are the really basic prompt used:

```
 write 2 virtual devices, 1 that will be an arpegiator (without checking the existing arpegiator, yours will be another one), and a device that takes 2 inputs and route one of the input to the output a little bit in the same way the "Switch" virtual device is working. Do not use _open_port and _close_port at the moment.
```


```
Can you generate the virtual device of an 8 step sequencer? Do not use _open_port and _close_port at the moment.
