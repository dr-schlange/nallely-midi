<h1
id="a-small-organic-live-programmable-modular-brain-for-midi-and-cv-like-signals">A
Small Organic Live-Programmable Modular Brain for MIDI and CV-like
Signals</h1>
<p>Nallely - pronounced “Nayeli” - is an organic open-source Python
platform for modular signal processing and meta-synth creation. Nallely
lets you build your own modular instrument or machine from any signal
producing source: MIDI devices, sensors, webcams, or even other
computers on the same network. Signals can be generated, transformed,
filtered, or split, then routed back into MIDI devices or into any
application registered in a Nallely session. Designed for hackers and
musicians, Nallely supports live coding, complex MIDI routing,
generative music, and multimodal art.</p>

<p>Think of Nallely as a small brain, where each device acts a bit like
a biological neuron by receiving and emitting signals. Each neuron runs
independently on its own thread, and they can connect in countless ways
by exchanging messages with each other. By wiring them freely, you can
link neurons that in a “normal” brain would not usually communicate. The
result is a small brain that can behave like a regular one, or like a
brain under psychedelics, mapped in unusual ways, producing unexpected,
but always amazing results. Nallely is designed for experimentation,
happy accidents, and emergent behavior.</p>

<p>Inspired by the “Systems as Living Things” philosophy and by
Smalltalk, Nallely tries to be as dynamic as possible: you can create
your own meta-synth and build your custom MIDI brain while it’s running,
from any computer or phone on the network (with a touch-friendly
interface). Developed in Python, Nallely exposes an extensible core and
an easy-to-use Python API, so you can create your own neurons without
efforts, and have them integrated directly into the system in a seemless
way.</p>

<p>Nallely comes with a set of pre-existing neurons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstraction of the physical world that can create sound using MIDI
devices (the “voice” for your brain);</li>
<li>signal-processing neurons that filter, transform, split, or generate
signals;</li>
<li>network buses, where distributed remote neurons coded in any
technology can register and emit or receive signals;</li>
<li>meta-neurons which can control, create, modify other neurons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nallely includes a few remote neurons coded in JavaScript,
introducing 3D visuals (mental imagery for your brain) that can be
controlled by signals received from your Nallely session (your modular
brain instance). It also includes a webcam-aware neuron, providing
visual input to your small MIDI brain (the “eyes” for your brain).</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-different-from-existing-systems">How is it different
from existing systems?</h2>
<p>Nallely has properties that are different from traditional modular
synthesis softwares:</p>
<ul>
<li>each module (neuron) runs in its own independent thread and
communicates with others neurons (or your synths) by sending
asynchronous messages. This property (message sending), copied from
Smalltalk and reactive actor-based systems, enables neuron isolation,
resiliency and fault-tolerancy. If a module “fails”, the system
continues to run, and lets you the possibility to kill the faulty
module, or live-debug it and restart it;</li>
<li>it emulates time, running by wall-clock and doesn’t simulate time.
There is no global tick, no global clock: each module can run a it’s own
speed;</li>
<li>synchronization happens, because it happens, not because it’s
enforced;</li>
<li>everything is a signal. MIDI notes and CV-like data is unified as a
stream of numbers. You don’t need to wonder which kind of patch you need
to use, which CC you should target, how to map the information range,
all is automatical: the patch jit-compiles a small adapter when you
connect two ports to ensure speed and hide dedicated behaviors;</li>
<li>patchs are directed, they indicate how the signal will be sent from
one neuron to another;</li>
<li>ports can be input and output at the same time. Depending on how the
module is developed, a port can yield datas or receive data. This
enables a new class of modules where you can can seemlessly code
reaction chains, observable memory, …;</li>
<li>talks network in an unified way;</li>
<li>patch from anywhere in the same network: sessions are headless and
are controlled by a web-interface. Connect to a session from your phone
or your laptop. The web-UI is stateless, if you’re connected to a
session, you’ll always be in sync with it;</li>
<li>all patch modification is versionned using Git: don’t loose your
patches, or their history, go back in time to revive a previous version,
branch to make experiments, sync your memory with a remote Git
repository to share your patches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="extensionhacking-is-encouraged">Extension/hacking is
encouraged</h2>
<p>Nallely is built to be fully extensible and hackable, at it’s core,
and at the neuron level, all live:</p>
<ul>
<li>you don’t like the web-interface? You can follow a simple small
protocol to control a running session and you’ll get a snapshot
representing the new full state of the session, letting you the option
to display it as you want;</li>
<li>you can live-code your Python neurons while the system runs, you can
create modules, edit the Python code from the web-UI, even debug it with
standard Python cli debugging tools;</li>
<li>you can live-patch your Python neurons while the system runs: modify
the code of your running module and directly sees the result. No need to
restart the system, no hot-reload, no instance re-creation, Nallely
embedds an object-centric hot-patch system with instance migration.
Never loose your code, all is versionned with git;</li>
<li>you can write your modules and code from your phone if you want, to
help you with bootstrapping new neurons, the code editor proposes a code
generator and a smart templating system relying on a user-driven
term-rewriting system. Write your own snippets templates, and recursive
templates grammar directly in the editor to help you code faster.</li>
<li>you don’t like Python? You can develop neurons in your favorite
language as long as it knows how to connect to a websocket server. Just
declare the ports your want to expose, register callbacks and your good
to go. There’s examples with webcam, finger trackings, gameboy emulator,
…, integrating a software to Nallely is easy and it opens for
experimentation;</li>
<li>neurons have access to an introspective API that lets them be able
to create new neurons instances, auto-patch themselves, monitor other
neurons, …</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="so">So…</h2>
<p>Nallely is not a DAW or a system for computer-based sound synthesis;
it’s more meta-synth focused and eventually a companion for your MIDI
devices: to combine or manipulate them in order to create a new
instrument, or to make semi-modular synths a little bit more
modular.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something that ensures strong strict time,
Nallely is not made for you. If you’re looking for high-predictability,
Nallely might not be for you.</p>
<p>By embracing asynchronous as first-class feature, Nallely is a
playground that promotes emergent behaviors. So, it’s not a DAW, it’s
not a DSP. It’s a playground for emergent behaviors, generative control,
and turning synth rigs into living systems in the form of a programmable
small living brain. Quickly experiments with crazy ideas: connect
everything with anything and everything.</p>
<p>Nallely is available, open-source, free, and will remain free and
open-source.</p>
